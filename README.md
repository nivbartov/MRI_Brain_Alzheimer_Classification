## Project Overview
In the cyber security world, efforts are made to protect computing systems from digital attacks which are an emerging thread nowadays. In machine learning, attackers employ Adversarial machine learning, a method designed to trick models using decieving data. This deceptive data is fed into the models as input, causing classifiers to make incorrect classifications.
We saw that in [reference [1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10456), medical images are vulnerable to adversarial attacks.
Acknowledging this vulnerability emphasizes the importance of enhancing the model's resilience.

In this project we try to make a robust model while achiving the two main goals :
1. defend against adverserial attacks in medical images , particularly in MRI alzhiemer classification. Meaning, whenever the model is under attack, it will still generalize and perform well.
2. Generalize well in the main classification task of the severity of the alziehmer disease.

In order to achieve our goals, we followed these steps:

1. **Model Fine-Tuning**: We fine-tuned three well-known models: DINOv2, ResNet34, and EfficientNet B0.

2. **Adversarial Attack Implementation**: We performed adversarial attacks using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), which were found to be effective attacks based on the findings in [reference  [6]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14133).

3. **Vulnerability Assessment**: After fine-tuning, we observed that the models were vulnerable to adversarial attacks. 

4. **Adversarial Training**: To enhance model robustness, we conducted adversarial training, focusing particularly on the PGD attack over the FGSM attack, as discussed in [reference [7]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14133).

5. **Model Ensemble**: Finally, we combined the three models using a voting approach to create a more resilient ensemble.

The project is implemented in Python using the PyTorch framework, which allows us to efficiently build and train our models throughout these steps.

## Data

Our project utilizes the [Best Alzheimer's MRI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lukechugh/best-alzheimer-mri-dataset-99-accuracy), a comprehensive and curated collection of MRI scans specifically designed for Alzheimer's classification. This dataset serves as an improved version of the raw dataset available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tourist55/alzheimers-dataset-4-class-of-images).

To address class imbalance, the dataset incorporates synthetic images generated through advanced techniques, ensuring a more balanced distribution of classes. The original real images have been allocated to the test directory for thorough evaluation.

All images have been resized to **224x224 pixels** to meet the input requirements of the deep learning models used in this project. The data is organized as follows:


A **`prepare_dataset.ipynb`** notebook located in the **`dataset`** directory is responsible for splitting the data into:

- **80%** for training
- **10%** for validation
- **10%** for testing

The data is structured as follows:

- **Training Set**: Contains both synthetic and real images, providing a balanced source for model training.
- **Validation Set**: Used for hyperparameter tuning and monitoring model performance during training to help prevent overfitting.
- **Test Set**: Comprises only real images for an unbiased final evaluation of the trained models.

## Models

* We provide pre-trained checkpoints for the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lukechugh/best-alzheimer-mri-dataset-99-accuracy) we used: the normal version and the under attack version. All model checkpoints should be placed inside the `/checkpoints` directory.
* For each model, the optuna parameters that were used for the training are also avaialble in a **json** file. In order to use the json file, place it under `/checkpoints/optuna_params`

## Results

## Usage

In this repository , you have the following usage options:

#### train a specific model

1. copy one of the models notebook **`dino_v2_model.ipynb`** , **`efficienetnet_model.ipynb`** ,**`resnet_model.ipynb`**. rename the new notebook to be **`*_model.ipynb`** where * is the name of your backbone.
2. follow up the notebooks structure:
  2.1. define the models architecture accordinglly. add the architecture to the file **`models/def_models.py`**
  2.2. If you are interested in transfer learning, set the **`requires_grad = False`** for layers you want to freeze. Otherwise, **`requires_grad = True`** for layers you want to fine tune.
  2.3. set **`load_existing_hyperparams = False`** if you want to perform the optuna search for the specific architecture and constraints of the model. define the number of epochs and trials for the search process as input parameters to  the function.
  2.4. define the number of epochs for the training.
  2.5. define the augmentations if needed.
  2.6. in the training process you have 2 options:
    *  Train from scratch. For this option , set the **`load_existing_params = False`**. 
    * reload an exisiting model. you can reload an existing model  that was previously trained and choose to train it or not.  Loading an exisiting model set **`load_existing_params =  True`**. for training a loaded model, set the **`train_loaded_model = True`** in addition.
  2.7. After the training process, the confusion matrix, loss curve and accuracy curve are saved under the `assets/*` when  `*` is the models name.

#### adversarial attacks: training and attacking
**Note:** This option can be performed only if you have a **pretrained model** with a defined architecture under the **`models/def_models.py`** file.

Here are the common steps for both options:
1. copy one of the models notebook **`dino_v2_model_atk.ipynb`** , **`efficienetnet_model_atk.ipynb`** ,**`resnet_model_atk.ipynb`**. rename the new notebook to be **`*_model_atk.ipynb`** where * is the name of your backbone.
2. set the models definition from the training process under no attacks.
3. set **`load_existing_hyperparams = True`** if you want to use the previous optuna hyper-parameters that you found in the first training process under no attacks. This is the recommended approach. Otherwise you can set **`load_existing_hyperparams = False`** and make a new optuna search.
4. Load the pretrained model. set the **`pretrained_model_path`** parameter to the path of your pretrained model.

##### perform attacks

* **FGSM attack** -  define the `Epsilon` value you want to perform the attack with. It is recommended to set a small number of `Epsilon` if you are limited with resources.
plot the adversarial examples using the `utils_funcs.plot_adversarial_examples` function. 
here is how:
`utils_funcs.plot_adversarial_examples(epsilons, examples, attack_name='fgsm', parameter_type = 'Epsilon')`.
This function will show the correct labels and the adversarial classification of the model for each `Epsilon`.

* **PGD attack** -  first, define the `Epsilon` and `num_iter` values you want to perform the attack with.Then, define the `Alpha` values.They can be smaller than `Epsilon/num_iter`(the `Epsilon` defines the radious for petubations) only.
plot the adversarial examples using the `utils_funcs.plot_adversarial_examples` function. 
here is how:
`utils_funcs.plot_adversarial_examples(alphas, examples , attack_name='pgd', parameter_type = 'Alpha')`.
This function will show the correct labels and the adversarial classification of the model for each `Alpha`.


##### adversarial attacks training

1. define the following parameters : `Epsilon`, `num_iter`, `Alpha`(see contraints under [PGD attack](#pgd-attack)), `adv_weight`, `num_epochs`.
2. define the number of epochs for the training.
3. define the augmentations if needed.
4. in the training process you have 2 options:
    *  Train from scratch. For this option , set the  **`load_existing_params = False`**. 
    * reload an exisiting model. you can reload an  existingmodel  that was previously trained and choose to   train itor not.  Loading an exisiting model   set**`load_existing_params =  True`**. for training a   loadedmodel, set the **`train_loaded_model = True`**  inaddition.
5. After the training process, the confusion matrix, loss curve and accuracy curve are saved under the `assets/*` when  `*` is the models name.


  

## Future Work

1. **Investigation advanced Targeted/Untargeted Attacks and Black-Box Attacks**: Future work can include investigating various targeted attacks, including advanced versions of FGSM such as Iterative FGSM (I-FGSM), Targeted I-FGSM, IND and OOD attacks, Kryptonite Attacks and one pixel attacks. These attacks can be performed in a targeted manner to evaluate the model's vulnerabilities and also in an untargeted way. Additionally, we can further explore black-box attacks when the model is not available to the attacker.

2. **Diverse Datasets**: In the future we plan to utilize a more diverse dataset featuring various MRI images across different demographics and orientations. Currently, we used the T1 MRI. we can incorporate the T2 and more...
We can also use a multi-modal data such as PET and CT scans.

3. **RNN Performance Evaluation**: We will assess the performance of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to determine their contribution to the robustness of the ensemble model.

4. **Ensemble Method Exploration**: Various ensemble techniques, such as stacking and blending.

5. **Real-World Testing**: Conducting real-world tests in collaboration with radiologists and people that are responsible for the reliability of medical data - images in particular. This can check the model's applicability and his reliability in the real world.
